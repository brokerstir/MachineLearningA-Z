# Simple Linear Regression

# Importing the libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('Salary_Data.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values # -1 removes last col, makes matrix of features / independent variables
y = dataset.iloc[:, 1].values # 1 selects only 2nd col for dependent variable vector

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set, make test size a third 
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split

# Feature Scaling, comment out because not needed for simple linear regression, as library takes care of it.
